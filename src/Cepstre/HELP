THIS IS A GUIDE FOR TO HELP YOU USE OUR ALGORITHMS

1- We test all the implemented functions in main.m

2- MFCC.m is the function used to calculate MFCC vector of a sound: it uses Framing.m, MelFilterBank.m and DCT.m

3- predict.m is the function used to recognize a recorded sound among sounds already recorded in sounds file (database).

We only test for vowels sounds (database):

sound1 --> sound A

sound2 --> sound O

sound3 --> sound I

sound4 --> sound E

sound5 --> sound U

Sounds to predict are '.wav' files record%d.wav.

4- To record a new voice, use the function record.m with Fe = 16000 Hz. Feel free to choose the name of your recorded sample.


N.B: add to path the folder audio and its subfolders to avoid errors while running the code.
